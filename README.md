Loan Application:

Users can apply for loans by providing the loan amount, tenure, and purpose.
Validation of loan amount and tenure to ensure they meet predefined criteria.
Duplicate loan applications are checked to maintain data integrity.
Loan Status Tracking:

Users can view the status of their loan applications.
Access is restricted to ensure users can only view their applications.
Admin Dashboard:

Admin users can access a dashboard to view all loan applications.
Admins can approve or reject loan applications.
Validation ensures that only authorized users can perform admin actions.
Error Handling and Notifications:

User-friendly error messages are displayed for various scenarios (e.g., invalid input, unauthorized access).
Notifications for successful actions (e.g., loan applications submitted, registrations successful).
